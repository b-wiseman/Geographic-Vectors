This is an assignment from CSCI 444 Data Visualization. We were tasked with creating a visualization regarding geographic vectors. 
I decided to map out all cell phone towers in the United States in order to determine if every U.S. county contains at least one cell phone tower. 
I learned a lot about using a visualization language called Vega as well as way to think about creating a great visual.
